* Love to design simple, elegant and optimal solutions that are balanced with business needs
* You raise the bar technically, and are tenacious, curious and collaborative in all aspects of your work
* Are a quick learner and have excellent communication skills

## Small print

* This is a remote or telecommute position
* We are cool with part-time and weird schedules
* English is not strictly necessary. Portuguese is fine, as long as you can comment your code in English
