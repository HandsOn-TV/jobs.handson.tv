Ideally you should have experience building RESTful web services, preferably with Node.js or Java, and had exposure to NoSQL databases. Experience wiht non-blocking frameworks is a big advantage, as well as AWS and continuous integration environments.

If you are passionate about building distributed systems that are that resilient, performant and scalable, and love working with the latest technologies, then we are eager to talk to you.

## What we are looking for

* Deep understanding software design patterns mixed with a healthy passion for keeping things simple
* Experience in Node.js, Java or similar language
* Deep understanding of web frameworks (Express/Jersey/Vert.x/Netty)
* Experience building RESTful web services and working with a service oriented architecture
* Designing and taking advantage of NoSQL databases (Cassandra/MongoDB)

## What would be nice to have

* Experience with non-blocking frameworks (Netty/Vert.x)
* Experience in front-end development with JavaScript/JQuery/Angular/Ember
* Exposure to recommendation algorithms
* Understanding of memory-based cache systems (Redis/memcached)

* Love to design simple, elegant and optimal solutions that are balanced with business needs
* You raise the bar technically, and are tenacious, curious and collaborative in all aspects of your work
* Are a quick learner and have excellent communication skills

## Small print

* This is a contract position
* This is a remote or telecommute position
* We are cool with part-time and weird schedules
* English is not strictly necessary. Portuguese is fine, as long as you can comment your code in English
